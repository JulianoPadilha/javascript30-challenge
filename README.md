# JavaScript30 Challenge

Build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript; no frameworks, libraries, etc. Pacing is totally up to the individual; if you feel like knocking out 30 challenges in 30 minutes, hey, more power to you, but that would miss the point of this course (IMO). The idea behind these exercises is to utilize small amounts of what would regularly be 'downtime' as moments in which we can build on our knowledge through some simple exercises. My goal is to participate in 3 challenges per day (watch the videos, take some notes, etc.) and to complete one challenge per day.

The starter files include solutions to most challenges, so this isn't really meant to be taken as some kind of competition or something. JavaScript30 appears to be focused more on helping developers enhance their current skillset and reducing developer reliance on external JS libraries; if it can be done with a JS library, it can (probably) be done with vanilla JS.
